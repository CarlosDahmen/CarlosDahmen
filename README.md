## About me

I'm a Colombian ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ born Civil Engineer who decided to move to the US ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ looking for better professional opportunities. After six years building water infrastructure in a Project Engineer role, I decided to pursue a career in software development! I completed Fullstack Academy's Full-Stack Software Engineering bootcamp in NY, and am currently looking for my first role as a software dev :)

Since graduating from Fullstack, I've been focusing in Front-End technologies such as React and Next, and have taken courses in Typescript and Test-Driven Development using React Testing Library

Currently working on [SET!}(https://carlosdahmen.github.io/setGame), a front-end implementation of the card game Set!

### Here are some deployed projects I've developed:

- [Namegame](https://CarlosDahmen.github.io):
  A front-end app developed with Typescript that consumes an existing API to create a name-guessing game.
  Global state managed by Redux; local state with React Hooks.
  Tech Stack: TypeScript, CSS, Node, Express, React, Redux

- [Wordle](https://carlosdahmen.github.io/wordle/):
  An implementation of the popular wordle game by Josh Wardle built with React, with global state handled with React Context, and game logic implemented   using React Hooks.
  
  Tech Stack: React (Context and Custom Hooks), React Testing Library, webpack, CSS

I'm currently in Charlottesville VA, but open to relocate for the right opportunity!

Technologies I'm proficient in:

JavaScript | Node | TypeScript | React | Next | Redux | React Testing Library | Express | HTML  | CSS | Sequelize | PostgreSQL | Git | Github
